# Serious_Games_Project

Serious Games Project for my Honours year in BSc Computer Games Technology.

This project is to create a simple engine based on the Cherno's engine: Hazel, to create a serious game.
The purpose of this game will be to learn japanese characters (Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji) by putting the player in a wizard place. He will draw those characters with his wand to throw spells
